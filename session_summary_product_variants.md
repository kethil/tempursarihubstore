### **Project: Tempursari Hub Store - Phase 2 Development**

**Last Session Summary:**

We have started implementing the **"Product Variations"** feature from Phase 2 of the Product Requirements Document.

**Completed Steps:**

1.  **Database Migration for Product Variations:**
    *   A new database migration script has been created at `supabase/migrations/20250826000000_add_product_variants.sql`.
    *   This script adds the necessary tables (`attributes`, `attribute_values`, `product_variants`, `product_variant_values`) to support product variations like size and color.
    *   It also modifies the existing `products`, `cart_items`, and `order_items` tables to work with the new variation system.

**Next Steps (To Be Completed):**

1.  **Apply the Database Migration:** The user needs to apply the newly created migration to their Supabase database by running `npx supabase db push` in their project terminal.
2.  **Update Supabase Type Definitions:** After the migration, the auto-generated TypeScript types for the database need to be updated to include the new tables. This is typically done by running `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`.
3.  **Update "Add Product" Form:** The admin dashboard's form for adding products needs to be updated to allow for the creation and management of product variations.
4.  **Update Product Detail Page:** The public-facing product page needs to be modified to display variation selection options (e.g., dropdowns for size and color).
5.  **Update "Add to Cart" Logic:** The cart functionality needs to be updated to handle adding specific product variants to the cart.
